1. Carbon Monoxide (CO) Prediction Using Air Quality Data
Project Aim:
The goal was to predict carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the air using the historical data from the Air Quality UCI dataset. By applying time-series analysis and machine learning techniques, this project aimed to forecast CO concentrations and provide insights for environmental health monitoring.
What Was Done:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned dataset by handling invalid entries, formatted time columns, and filled missing data using forward filling.
Feature Engineering: Created time-based features (e.g., Hour, DayOfWeek, Month) to capture seasonal patterns influencing CO levels.
Model Development: Used an XGBRegressor to predict CO levels, after scaling the data using StandardScaler.
Prediction & Evaluation: The model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and used to forecast CO levels for the next 24 hours.
Visualization: Generated plots comparing historical CO levels with forecasted values.
Comments and Suggestions:
Data quality significantly impacts prediction accuracy.
Further feature engineering could incorporate weather data.
Hyperparameter tuning and real-time data integration can enhance model performance.

2. Wind Turbine Performance Analysis and Prediction
Project Aim:
The objective was to predict the operational status of wind turbines by comparing their measured power output with the theoretical power curve. The project aimed to identify underperformance or inefficiencies in turbines, helping with optimization and maintenance.
What Was Done:
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring correct column formats.
Feature Engineering: Created lag features to capture temporal dependencies, such as Wind_Lag1 and Wind_Lag7.
Model Building: Implemented multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN) for classifying turbine operational status.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the Random Forest model using grid search.
Feature Importance: Assessed which features were most influential using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
Comments and Suggestions:
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models performed best, but further optimization is needed.
Additional features, such as turbine maintenance history and environmental factors, could improve the model.
Real-time prediction and cloud deployment for turbine monitoring would enhance the projectâ€™s impact.
